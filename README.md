# Recipe Newsletter

A weekly newsletter that will be sent out to subscribers showcasing various recipes. Users can create an account, log in, log out, and subscribe. Ideally, we will have the subscription service set up so that anyone who chooses to subscribe will receive an email when a new recipe is posted onto the site. Users can access their forgotten password via an email. Users can filter recipes through a multitude of options, such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, vegan, and desserts. Users will also be able to filter recipes by a predefined skill level. They can also favorite certain recipes, which would show up in a Favorites tab. The navbar will also contain a search bar, so that users can find recipes that include specific ingredients, on the basis that they would be searching for something to cook with ingredients they have on hand. Each recipe will include button or checkbox to favorite, a picture of the finished product, the skill level of the recipe, the estimated time to make, and the estimated yield of food. Each recipe will also have a button to drop down the container and reveal the ingredients and instructions on how to make it. Clicking the button again will hide the ingredients and instructions.
